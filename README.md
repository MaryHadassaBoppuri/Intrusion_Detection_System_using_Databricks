# Intrusion_Detection_System_using_Databricks

# Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) and Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPSs) are the best defense tools aganist different network attacks.

# There are different types of network attacks such as DOS HULK, Dos GoldenEye, DoS SlowLoris, DoS Slowhttptest. These are clustered into two tyes of attacks:
# BENIGN(Normal), DoS(Attack) and in this we have three different types of network data such as Packet info, Payload info, Session info.

# Here in this project, I have built an ML model which can detect network attacks.
