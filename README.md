# Intrusion_Detection_System_using_Databricks

# Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) and Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPSs) are the best defense tools againinst different network attacks.

# There are differnt types of network attack such as DOS HULK, Dos GoldenEye, DoS SlowLoris, DoS Slowhttptest these are clustered into two tyes of attacks naming
